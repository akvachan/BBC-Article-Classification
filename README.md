# BBC-Article-Classification
BBC Article Classification and Visualisation using Embeddings and Dense Neural Network

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of TensorFlow to classify BBC news articles into predefined categories. Utilizing a dataset of BBC articles, the project employs natural language processing techniques, including tokenization and stopwords removal, to prepare the data. A neural network model is then built and trained to categorize new articles accurately.

## Features
- Preprocessing of text data to remove common English stopwords.
- Tokenization and sequence padding to convert text into a format suitable for neural network training.
- A neural network model with an embedding layer, a dense layer with ReLU activation, and a softmax output layer for multi-class classification.
- Evaluation of model performance through accuracy and loss metrics.
- Visualization of training process and word embeddings.
